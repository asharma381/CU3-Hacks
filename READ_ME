Start Recycling and stop 

Website and Application

Our Website was made to educate people in our society to learn how to recycle

This app is an app that shows you if an item is recyclable or not. Repsychology was developed by Aditya Sharma, 
Pranava Parasa, Nikhil Pillai, Aayush Bhat, Bill Xiang. The EPA estimates that 75% of the American waste stream 
is recyclable, but we only recycle about 30% of it, and we wanted to do something about it, so we made this app.

In today’s electronic age, people are starting to consider going paperless. But there’s still a long way to go 
before we lose our dependence on this very important human product. From our newspapers to our paper wrappings, 
paper is still everywhere and most of them are ending up in our landfills creating a staggering amount of paper 
waste. There was a time when paper was a rare and precious commodity. Now it fills our planet.
